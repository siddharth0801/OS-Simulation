Simulation of Operating System (Process Management): 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Simulation of processes in shared computer system, to check performance of the system
against sequential execution of processes.
Each process is CPU-bound or IO-bound (spending 80% time in -bound activity)
CPU can be used by only one process at a time.
IO can be shared by any number of processes, but getting slower by 5% for every
additional user.
Maximum CPU slot of 100 ms.
Simulate above situation so that we can check performance for:
Approximately 20 processes every minute, each needing execution time of approx 3 to 8
seconds if run alone.
and check performance for following percentage of IO-bound processes
(0,20,40,60,80,100).
Run simulation for processes getting generated for 5 minutes, and data collection till all
processes are completed.
